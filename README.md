Simple Redis based locking utils

#testing

To run the tests use the idea and start a redis by e.g. entering 'docker-compose up' in a terminal
in the root folder of the project. The tests fail at the moment if run via sbt shell, probably due
to configuration not being recognised. Should become fixed.
